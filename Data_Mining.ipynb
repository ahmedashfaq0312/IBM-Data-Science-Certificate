        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The CRISP-DM methodology serves as a structured approach to leverage data mining across diverse business sectors and applications. Its primary aim is to render case-specific scenarios into domain-neutral constructs, fostering broader applicability. Consisting of six sequential steps, CRISP-DM necessitates meticulous implementation for a realistic chance of success.\n",

        "1. **Understanding Business Context**\n",
        "2. **Exploring Data**\n",
        "3. **Preparing Data**\n",
        "4. **Modeling**\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**\n",
        "6. **Deployment**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding Business Context\n",
        "\n",
        "The cornerstone of the CRISP-DM methodology lies in this initial stage, where project objectives are delineated. Alignment between Foundational Methodology and CRISP-DM is crucial here, demanding clear communication and unambiguous goals. However, stakeholders' diverse objectives and perspectives often pose challenges, underscoring the need for comprehensive clarity to avoid resource wastage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploring Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Aligned closely with business understanding, this stage entails the collection of pertinent data. The nature of collected data hinges upon the insights derived from business goals and requirements. CRISP-DM integrates aspects of data requirements, collection, and comprehension from the Foundational Methodology, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between business objectives and data acquisition.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "Following data collection, a preparatory phase ensues to transform raw data into a usable format, discarding or augmenting datasets as necessary. Data integrity checks are imperative, identifying and rectifying questionable, missing, or ambiguous data points. Data preparation serves as a common thread between CRISP-DM and the Foundational Methodology, facilitating seamless transition to subsequent stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "With data primed for analysis, modeling techniques are employed to extract meaningful insights and generate new knowledge. This phase epitomizes the essence of data mining, uncovering patterns and structures within the dataset. Model selection, both an art and science, is pivotal, often requiring iterative adjustments. The convergence of Foundational Methodology and CRISP-DM sets the stage for informed decision-making in subsequent phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "The efficacy of selected models is rigorously evaluated through testing on distinct datasets, gauging their performance against new data. Insights gleaned from this evaluation inform decisions regarding model efficacy and its role in subsequent phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "The culmination of the CRISP-DM process sees the application of the developed model to new data and stakeholders. Interactions at this juncture may reveal unanticipated variables or requirements, necessitating revisions to business strategies, models, or datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "CRISP-DM stands as a dynamic and iterative framework, demanding flexibility and continuous communication at every stage. The cyclical nature of the process underscores the importance of revisiting earlier stages as needed, ensuring alignment with evolving business needs. Ultimately, CRISP-DM fosters an ongoing journey of exploration and adaptation, facilitating informed decision-making and sustained business relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Formulas\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of mathematical formulas is prevalent in data modeling. For example, the formula for calculating the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of a dataset is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "\\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "where \\(N\\) is the number of data points and \\(x_i\\) represents each individual data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Example\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "\n",
        "# Sample code demonstrating data preprocessing\n",
        "data = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n",
        "# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
        "cleaned_data = preprocess_data(data)\n",
        "# Split data into training and testing sets\n",
        "train_data, test_data = split_data(cleaned_data, test_size=0.2)\n",
        "# Train a machine learning model\n",
        "model = train_model(train_data)\n",
        "# Evaluate the model\n",
        "accuracy = evaluate_model(model, test_data)\n",
